Breaking Point Mod ( Core Client / Server Code + Assets ) 

## Configuration

* Download the BreakingPoint Client + Server files to your server (A batch file will be included in a tools folder for steam cmd users).

* Import the included breakingpoint.sql file from the SQL folder to a clean database and make sure you have a sql account that has full access to that database.

* Copy the ServerConfig folder to your ArmA server directory.
* Open the BreakingPointExt.ini in ServerConfig and change the database ip, name, username, password and port to the ones you setup earlier.
``` [DATABASE]
 ip = 127.0.0.1
 port = 3306
 database = breakingpointmod
 username = root
 password =
```

* Open the config.cfg in ServerConfig directory and setup your instance, this is important to remember for each server you host.
``` class Params
 {
 	instance = 1;
 	debug = false;
 };
To can find instance values in your database manager: go to the instance table and look at the world id.
```
